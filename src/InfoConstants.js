    WELCOME_TEXT: 'Welcome to the Wallet Watchoor™ handbook. Wallet Watchoor is a dashboard for Ethereum and other EVM based chains, where you can view transactions from addresses you have followed. All that is required is a web3 wallet provider such as Metamask installed on your browser, which I assume you have because well why else would you be here. Your feed periodically updates every 15 seconds with new transactions from your watched addresses if any were detected. While you are watching™, you can chat with fellow watchoors in the Trollbox — a horrible knockoff of the bitmex™ trollbox that some of us knew and loved. Along with chatting, you can share transactions from your feed to keep other watchoors informed. There is also an optional Dosbox window you can open where you can play classic Dos games if you get bored. That about sums up the general functionality of this site. For more specific info and guidance, click on the more specific topics listed on the left.',
