# What is WalletWatchoor?

Wallet Watchoor allows you to track any address on chain, and receive audio alerts in your browser whenever transactions are sent to or from that address. Whether it be transfers from an influencer or hedge fund's address, transfers of a certain ERC-20 token, or transfers of a specific ERC-721 NFT collection, never be suprised again. Start by connecting your wallet so you can access the app and explore the many features it has to offer. If you don't have metamask or a web3 wallet provider installed in your browser, you won't be able to access the app. You can install metamask via the link below.
